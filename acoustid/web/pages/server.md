Title: Server

AcoustID server is a web application written in Python. It consists of this
website and handlers for the [web service](/webservice), which allow users
to look up and submit fingerprints.

Fingerprint lookups are currently implemented using [PostgreSQL GIN indexes][gin],
but there are plans to implement a custom special-purpose index server for
more efficient searches.
