Title: Database

The main part of the AcoustID database is publicly available. That includes
user-submitted audio fingerprints, their mapping to MusicBrainz IDs and
some other mappings.

The data is published daily, as incremental update files in JSON format,
which you can use to reconstruct the database and keep it up to udate.
The files can be downloaded [here](http://data.acoustid.org/).

The data is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
Unported License][cc], with the exception of the MusicBrainz-AcoustID mapping
which can be considered [public domain][pd].
