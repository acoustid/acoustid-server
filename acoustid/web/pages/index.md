Title: Welcome to AcoustID!

AcoustID is a project providing complete audio identification
service, based entirely on open source software.

It consists of a [client library](/chromaprint) for generating
compact fingerprints from audio files, a large crowdsourced
[database of audio fingerprints](/database), many of which are linked
to the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) metadata
database using their [unique identifiers](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier), and a [web service](/webservice)
that enables applications to quickly search in the fingerprint database.

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>
    If you have an unknown music file, one of the applications using
    AcoustID will very likely be able to tell you what song it is,
    who wrote it, and a lot more. In case AcoustID doesn't recognize
    the song yet, you can help by submitting it to the database, so
    that the next person trying to identify the same song will
    have more luck.
